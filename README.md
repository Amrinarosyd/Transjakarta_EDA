### ‚≠êÔ∏è Understanding the Data
üå∏This data is about accummulation of transjakarta passangers type of BRT, Mikrotrans, and Angkutan Umum Integrasi. The time period is from the month of January 2021 - December 2021.   
üå∏TransJakarta is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. It was the first BRT system in Southeast Asia and commenced operation in January 2004.   
üå∏The integrated system of TransJakarta refers to the interconnected network of different transportation services to provide a seamless travel experience for passengers.

1. **BRT (Bus Rapid Transit):** This is the primary service offered by TransJakarta. The BRT system operates on dedicated bus lanes, and it's designed to be a high-capacity, efficient public transit system that can bypass Jakarta's notorious traffic congestion. It serves a large number of routes across the city.
2. **Mikrotrans:** This is a feeder bus service that connects neighborhoods and smaller routes to TransJakarta BRT corridors. Mikrotrans busses are smaller than BRT busses, which allows them to navigate narrow streets.
3. **Angkutan Umum Integrasi (Integrated Public Transportation):** These are integrated transportation services that connect TransJakarta stations with non-BRT or Mikrotrans points.

The integrated system is designed to make traveling between Jakarta's services easier. Passengers can use a single ticket (usually a prepaid card) to move between services.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è The Problems:
In order to improve the Transjakarta service in terms of facilities, fleet, and routes, the Transjakarta team requires supporting data to make informed decisions and solve problems. The following are the questions that need to be addressed in order to optimize the service:

1. Identify which routes serve the most passengers in total 
2. Analyze the average number of passengers per month for each transportation route.
3. Identifying the routes with the lowest number of passengers.  
4. Identifying the vehicle type with the highest number of passengers.   
5. Understanding the times at which routes have the most significant number of passengers.   

By answering these questions, the Transjakarta team will gain valuable insights to enhance service, improve facilities, fleet management, and optimize routes according to passenger needs and preferences.
